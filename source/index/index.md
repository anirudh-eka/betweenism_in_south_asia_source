On paper Hinduism and Islam couldn't be more different. The former boasts a pantheon of thousands of deities often revered in the form of idols, while the later instructs that there is only one God and to pray to an idol is a sin. However, despite these differences, both religions have shared South Asia as a home for over a thousand years. 

The color picker below is a model to explore the meshing between these two religions at different layers. Click on various points in the color picker to discover quotes from scholars, poets, mystics, and religious texts from Islam, Hinduism and the traditions in-between!

  	<p> Where the saturation is highest, you will notice the text is instructional dictating what rituals followers should perform, what clothes they should wear, and other outward activities. As the saturation declines towards white, the text becomes less dictatorial and more phylosophical engaging the rational mind.</p>

## Conflict between Hues and between Saturations

The conflict between hues, that is between different religious traditions is age old. These conflicts take the form of crusades, persecution, preferential treatment, and communal violence. The demogogues from each of these traditions purport the differences between them are irreconcilable and violence is an inevitable "Clash of Civilization". I hope the model above shows that given time a gradient of traditions will form, and in the case of South Asia has formed, between different "civilizations".

 This conflict in my opinion is too familiar to need more exploration.

What I find more interesting is the conflict between different Saturations within the same Hue. 



It is true humility. Acknowledgement that the human mind is feeble in understanding the true 'oneness' of the universe/God/Allah/Brahman... In fact to try to understand and explain it is to chop up reality that is to chop


To capture this idea that as people from either faith contemplate more abstractly about the nature of reality, they shed the layers of ritual that make the faiths distinguishable, .
